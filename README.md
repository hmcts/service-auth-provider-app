This microservice is used to authenticate services across HMCTS.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [JDK 8](https://java.com)
 
### Building
To build the project execute the following command:
```bash
$ ./gradlew build
```

### Configuration

In order to setup Service Auth Provider to work with a client service, you need to do the following:

* In the Azure Key Vault named `s2s-{environment}` add the service's secret used for generating OTPs (one-time passwords).
This has to be done in each environment the service is going to be deployed to. Service Auth Provider will use that secret
for validating OTPs. It has to be a BASE32-encoded sequence of ten random bytes (16 characters after encoding). By convention,
the Azure Key Vault secret's name should follow this format: `microservicekey-{service-name}`. [Here's](#generating-secret) how to generate it.
* To make it work on AKS , Add the client service name (as in HTTP requests ) and Azure Key Vault secret created in the previous steps to [values.yaml](charts/rpe-service-auth-provider/values.yaml). 
A service **TEST_SERVICE** with secret key **microservicekey-test-service**  needs to be configured as below :

 ```
java:
  keyVaults:
    "s2s":
      secrets:
        - name: microservicekey-test-service
          alias: microserviceKeys.test_service
```
 Note: **test_service** is lower cased in alias mapping, though its not mandatory. 
* Bump the helm chart minor version in [Chart.yaml](charts/rpe-service-auth-provider/Chart.yaml) 

#### <a name="generating-secret"></a>Generating the microservice secret

Here's a sample Java snippet to generate a microservice secret:

```
byte[] bytes = new byte[10];
SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong().nextBytes(bytes);
String secret = new Base32().encodeAsString(bytes);
```

Sample Python code to generate that secret:

```
import os
import base64
base64.b32encode(os.urandom(10))
```
#### Writing a secret into all the needed vaults
Please make sure `realpath` is installed as script uses it.
```
Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install coreutils
OS X  : brew install coreutils

On Debian or Ubuntu realpath should be installed by default
```
There's a script provided `./bin/set-secret-in-all-vaults <microservice-name>`
This will write the secret into all the vaults and then it will run the check script to check it can find the secret

You need to have the `azure-cli` installed and be logged in (`az login`) for it to work, also ensure you are in the `dcd_reform_dev_logs` group in AAD.

#### Getting the change to production
Create a pull request after you've set the secret in all vaults, once your build is green you can request a review by posting on the #platops-code-review Slack channel.
If the build is green, and the PR template was filled out correctly showing that the secret has been entered in all vaults then the change will be merged and a build automatically triggered. Once the build is finished and passed it will be automatically deployed to the AAT and production environments. If you need it in demo you can merge the code to demo and `git push`.

#### Reading the secret in client service's infrastructure code

Once the service's secret is stored in Azure Key Vault, it can be retrieved
from the S2S key vault with Terraform and written into your own vault.

```hcl
data "azurerm_key_vault" "key_vault" {
  name                = "${var.product}-${var.env}" # update these values if required
  resource_group_name = "${var.product}-${var.env}" # update these values if required
}

data "azurerm_key_vault" "s2s_vault" {
  name                = "s2s-${var.env}"
  resource_group_name = "rpe-service-auth-provider-${var.env}"
}

data "azurerm_key_vault_secret" "key_from_vault" {
  name         = "microservicekey-ccd-data" # update key name e.g. microservicekey-your-name
  key_vault_id = data.azurerm_key_vault.s2s_vault.id
}

resource "azurerm_key_vault_secret" "s2s" {
  name         = "s2s-secret"
  value        = data.azurerm_key_vault_secret.key_from_vault.value
  key_vault_id = data.azurerm_key_vault.key_vault.id
}
```

### Running
To run the app execute:
```bash
$ ./gradlew bootRun
```
You can also run the app on docker.  
To build:
```bash
$ docker-compose build
```
And to run:
```bash
$ docker-compose up
```
Dockerized app comes with preconfigured sample service. See [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) for details.

## Documentation
